🔹 Q7 – Bitwise: Convert to Binary String (Manual)

Task:

Write a function:

String toBinary(int x)


that returns a 32-bit binary string manually using bitwise operations (no Integer.toBinaryString allowed).

Example:

Input: 5

Output: 00000000000000000000000000000101

Use shifts and masking (>>, & 1).


----------------------------------

🔹 Q9 – File Reading + Bitwise: IP Address Mask

Task:

Given a file ips.txt where each line contains an IP and a subnet mask length, e.g.:

192.168.1.10/24
10.0.0.5/16


Read each line and split into IP and mask length (e.g. 24).

Convert the IP into a 32-bit integer using bitwise operations.

Compute the network address by applying the mask.

Print the network address back in dotted decimal form.

(You don’t need to handle invalid IPs for now.)

--------------------------------------------

🔹 Q11 – Threads: Producer–Consumer with Blocking Queue (Concept Level)

Task:

Design a program where:

A Producer thread:

Reads lines from the console (or from a file),

Puts them into a BlockingQueue<String>.

A Consumer thread:

Takes each line from the queue,

Converts it to uppercase,

Prints it.

Stop condition:

When Producer reads "exit", it should stop and put a special value (e.g. null or "__END__") in the queue.

Consumer stops when it reads that special value.

(Use ArrayBlockingQueue or LinkedBlockingQueue.)

------------------------------------------


🔹 Q12 – Date & Time + File: Simple Log Filter

Task:

You have a log file app.log where each line starts with a timestamp:

2025-03-10T10:15:30Z User1 LOGIN
2025-03-10T10:16:00Z User2 LOGOUT
...


Write a program that:

Asks the user for:

start timestamp

end timestamp
(e.g. 2025-03-10T10:15:00Z and 2025-03-10T10:16:00Z)

Reads all lines from app.log.

Prints only those lines whose timestamp is between start and end (inclusive).

Use java.time (e.g. Instant or OffsetDateTime) to parse and compare times.
